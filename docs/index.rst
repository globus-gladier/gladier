===================================

Gladier: The Globus Architecture for Data-Intensive Experimental Research.

Gladier is a programmable data capture, storage, and analysis architecture for experimental facilities.
The architecture leverages a data/computing substrate based on 
data and compute agents deployed across computer and storage 
systems at APS, ALCF, and elsewhere, all managed by cloud-hosted Globus services.
