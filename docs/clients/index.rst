Gladier Client
=============

Gladier tools are reusable components that can be strung together to create
a new workflow. Each flow may be unique, but the components of a
workflow can usually be split into three parts: Transfer, Compute, Publication.

Each Gladier tool is a set of two things:

* A reusable set of FuncX functions
* An example introductory flow

Configuring A Gladier Client
--------------------------

Setup your Gladier Client with a list of the tools, endpoints, containers, etc; you want to use. 

The Gladier Client has built-in functions for automatically registering
and deploying FuncX functions and Automate Flows. Running the example
above looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

   hello_cli = HelloGladier()
   flow = hello_cli.start_flow()
